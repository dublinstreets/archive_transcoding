### the steps *

single cultural commodity from an Archive > long-term archival approach / solution > transcoding  into diverse media and formats 

### the starting point  - Text "The Man who Never Threw Anything Away" *

### the initial mindmap *

obsessive collecting of objects in space / ordering and labelling of objects

>

it is a to compensate the mental emptiness and loneliness / solitude 

>

also to isolate the Self and push the autonomy and independence of the Self, as it feels natural, it is a path

>

it is a patterned way of interaction with the surroundings, a particular strategy of an individual

>

on one side - independence and autonomy of Self in relation to the outer world

on another side - traces on loneliness / solitude are to be evident sooner or later 

>

### topic - Autonomous and / vs / yet Lonely Individual

Jasper Robert Grootveld * 

- Ditch Artist, 19 July 1932 – 26 February 2009
- Born in Amsterdam
- Had a specific philosophy regarding how the masses are brainwashed to become addicted consumers

> Robert Jasper Grootveld is one of the defining figures in post-war Dutch history.

> A man from the street who therefore fell outside all existing frameworks, but with his unique performances he eventually broke them open one by one.

> Around the age of eighteen he is deeply unhappy and he is admitted to a psychiatric hospital for observation.

> In the fifties he maintains, looking for attention, a whole series of homosexual relationships with men who are not only a lot older than him, but who seem to have had a much better life, including a banker, a television reporter , a (hurried) priest, a poet, a harbor baron, a real estate trader and a (popular) writer.

> Marijuana entered his life in the early 1960s. He also stops his homosexual contacts. It seems as if he is putting someone else in his place, who will not let him go for the rest of his life: Sinterklaas.

> He attacks the cigarette industry that manipulates people through advertising and blinded the dangers of smoking. In the fall of 1961, he began to paint cigarette advertising posters with 'cancer' or with a k.

> In 2007, his raft fleet is moored for the International Institute of Social History. RJG withdraws to a care home in Amsterdam.

Entry points to the Artefact / What is to be decoded:

— global entry points: the topics of self-sufficiency / autonomy / independency / self- reliance and it's practical & mental aspects 

— specific entry points: based on a particular article of a particular issue

### *** Talk w/ Martijn March 16th

- digital realm, how can you be self-sufficient online, that means you don't use Google services, email and you need to set up your own?
- digital counterpart for the topics/articles in the issues
- the Whole Earth catalogue
- define a research question
- what are analogue strategies to transcode an artefact?
- what are the digital tools to transcode an artefact?

### References:

- Whole Earth Catalogue

— self-sufficiency, ecology, alternative education, DIY, holism,

— convention-challenging experimentalism

— counterculture

- CoEvolution Quarterly

—  a journal which descended from Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog

- [Online books pages by subject](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/subjects.html)
- [Cool Tools](https://kk.org/cooltools/)

— a website, which recommends the best/cheapest tools available

— anything that can be useful

— reviews written by real students

- Drop City

— counterculture artists' community that formed in southern Colorado in 1965

—  the intention was to create a live-in work of Drop Art

— known as the first rural "hippie commune"

- Burning Man

— described by participants as an experimental society, radical self-expression and radical self-sufficiency

— the idea is that during Burning Man, people will temporarily build a community

— participants are expected to be self-sufficient in their needs such as food, water and a place to sleep

— Burning Man is very dependent on the efforts of volunteers

- Freetown Christiania

— is an intentional community and commune of about 850 to 1,000 residents, covering 7.7 hectares (19 acres) in the borough of Christianshavn in the Danish capital city of Copenhagen

*** To-do March 23th

- [x]  formulate a research question based on an artefact
- [x]  research the origins of the periodicals: editors, publisher, period, contributors, language
- [x]  search for the pdfs of the periodicals
- [x]  make an initial list of transcoding strategies / tools: digital and analogue

### *** Talk w/ Hannes March 23th

about my artefact:

- 1 way is transcoding the content of an artefact / 2 way is transcoding the context of an artefact

about transcoding:

- think of shapes for coming transcodings and quickly go for it, it can be rough
- what is lost and what is gained during transcoding
- what kind of things you'd like to make

about [read.me](http://read.me) file:

- [read.me](http://read.me) file is one to present to the public, cleaned and refined one
- images can be either embedded links
- make a personal google drive, collect images there for notion

### Just thinking:

- Does it mean that a person will have to cut down the needs to be self-sufficient in a digital realm?
- Transcoding will be into a parallel realm - which is digital / online existence

[Details about the Periodicals](https://www.notion.so/27246924a91d442cbc22775cddb5db64)

[Topics related to Self-Sufficiency](https://www.notion.so/982e852f5de1452681b0ee355805ce5f)

### *  Research Question #0:

What defines a culture of online self-sufficiency?

### *  Research Question #1 (main):

What strategies does the culture of online self-sufficiency use?

### Initial list of transcodings:

- manifestation
    - a self-filmed video of manifesto speech
- podcast
- masks, face filter, pixelization
- universal platform for online existence
    - alternative social media / forum

### *** Talk w/ Martijn March 30th

- create and maintain my own server
- how to make a self-sufficient video?
- open source community
- manifesto in 3 different mediums
- 3 different manifesto in 1 medium
- what elements define my existence online? e.g last time seen online, public IP address, internet provider, internet speed
- possible to set up own wifi network
