### the initial mindmap *

obsessive collecting of objects in space / ordering and labelling of objects

>

it is a to compensate the mental emptiness and loneliness / solitude 

>

also to isolate the Self and push the autonomy and independence of the Self, as it feels natural, it is a path

>

it is a patterned way of interaction with the surroundings, a particular strategy of an individual

>

on one side - independence and autonomy of Self in relation to the outer world

on another side - traces on loneliness / solitude are to be evident sooner or later 

>

Jasper Robert Grootveld * 

- Ditch Artist, 19 July 1932 – 26 February 2009
- Born in Amsterdam
- Had a specific philosophy regarding how the masses are brainwashed to become addicted consumers

> Robert Jasper Grootveld is one of the defining figures in post-war Dutch history.

> A man from the street who therefore fell outside all existing frameworks, but with his unique performances he eventually broke them open one by one.

> Around the age of eighteen he is deeply unhappy and he is admitted to a psychiatric hospital for observation.

> In the fifties he maintains, looking for attention, a whole series of homosexual relationships with men who are not only a lot older than him, but who seem to have had a much better life, including a banker, a television reporter , a (hurried) priest, a poet, a harbor baron, a real estate trader and a (popular) writer.

> Marijuana entered his life in the early 1960s. He also stops his homosexual contacts. It seems as if he is putting someone else in his place, who will not let him go for the rest of his life: Sinterklaas.

> He attacks the cigarette industry that manipulates people through advertising and blinded the dangers of smoking. In the fall of 1961, he began to paint cigarette advertising posters with 'cancer' or with a k.

> In 2007, his raft fleet is moored for the International Institute of Social History. RJG withdraws to a care home in Amsterdam.

Entry points to the Artefact / What is to be decoded:

— global entry points: the topics of self-sufficiency / autonomy / independency / self- reliance and it's practical & mental aspects 

— specific entry points: based on a particular article of a particular issue

*** Talk w/ Martijn March 16th

- digital realm, how can you be self-sufficient online, that means you don't use Google services, email and you need to set up your own?
- digital counterpart for the topics/articles in the issues
- the Whole Earth catalogue
- define a research question
